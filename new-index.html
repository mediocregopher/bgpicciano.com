                    My name is Brian Picciano. I'm a full-stack developer with a
                    focus on designing scalable backend architectures for web
                    applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have been in the web development industry for over ten
                    years, and during that time have been involved in every
                    aspect of building a web app. If you're having a problem,
                    there's a good chance I've solved it before.

                    I help you solve your problems, no matter what stage of
                    development you're at. Offerings include:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Development of a technology roadmap, so your app can scale
                      globally starting from <em>now</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Analysis of your current architecture to find the
                      weaknesses and bottlenecks which are going to afflict your
                      team down the line, and develop strategies for mitigating
                      them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Getting down into the weeds to track down those
                      impossible-to-find bugs, so you don't have to waste
                      valuable development time chasing them yourself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Actual hands-to-keyboard coding! If you just need one more
                      person to grind out that crucial feature before deadline,
                      I can be there.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
